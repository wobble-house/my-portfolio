    description:"I am a Full-Stack Developer and Business Operations whiz with experience leading teams of varying sizes and scope. For the last six years I have worked for A2IM, a US music business 501(c)6 not-for-profit trade organization. At A2IM I established a modern, cloud-based IT and web infrastructure, alongside managing live event production, contractors & varying other teams. Responsibilities also included in-person networking events as well as moderating live panels and webinars.\n\n  Before working for A2IM I helped grow a chain of retail stores in an emerging disruptive technology located in Manhattan & Brooklyn, NY. After originally taking a part-time position out of interest in a hobby, I ended up creating inventory and tracking systems that were scaled across 10+ stores as the industry exploded. I then took a position managing teams across multiple site locations.\n\n In prior experience I have held various other operations & management roles within a few different industries including industrial fiber optics/network installation, medical insurance, big-box retail, and even unfortunately, the pawn shop industry.\n\n On a personal note: Iâ€™m a father, musician and a gamer. I enjoy playing FPS games and fiddling with analogue synthesizers & other gadgets. Music originally brought me from my hometown in Tampa, Florida to Tennessee where I met my wife Heidi. We ventured to New York to fulfill our artistic destinies, and subsequently traveled back to Tennessee, where we now reside, nearly a decade later during the covid-19 pandemic. Not long afterwards our son Alan was born and we now enjoy our time outdoors together at our home in Chattanooga with our super cute cat Dwayne." }

    description:"I am a Full-Stack Developer and overall Business Operations whiz with experience leading teams of varying sizes and scope. I come from an operations focused background, with the past 6 years working for a 501(c)6 not-for-profit trade organization named A2IM, which is focused within the US music business industry.  At A2IM I established a more modern, cloud-based IT and web infrastructure alongside managing live event production contractors & varying other teams.  In conjunction with the development of business operations & procedures, I also participated in many of the numerous in-person networking events as well as moderated a live panel & webinar or two.\n\nBefore working for A2IM I helped grow a chain of retail stores in an emerging disruptive technology located in Manhattan & Brooklyn.  After originally taking a part-time position out of interest in a hobby, I ended up creating inventory and tracking systems that were scaled across 10+ stores as the industry exploded. I then took a position managing teams across multiple site locations.\n\nIn prior experience I have held various other operations & management roles within a few different industries including industrial fiber optics/network installation, medical insurance, big-box retail, and even unfortunately, the pawn shop industry.\n\nOn a personal note:  Iâ€™m a father, musician and a gamer.  I enjoy playing FPS games and fiddling with analogue synthesizers & other gadgets.  Music originally brought me from my hometown in Tampa, Florida to Tennessee where I met my wife Heidi. We both eventually ventured to New York to fulfill our artistic destinies and subsequently traveled back nearly a decade later during the covid-19 pandemic.  Not long afterwards our son Alan was born and we now enjoy our time outdoors together at our home in Chattanooga with our super cute cat Dwayne." }
